# Hi!
I'm the main developer working on a roblox game called StarLand and i publish random github projects on my spare time. I've written code in C, Lua, Batch, Shell and even scratch
‚≠ê's are not endorsements and neither are follows.
Every repository on my profile has something different to offer and i'm excited to keep going with my projects.
StarLand Development is currently on hiatus due to personal matters, but i'm going to slowly update it until i get back to full steam ahead. There's a lot left to do and i don't have enough hands. At the moment it's just me and a few friends working on this project
